Monday 9/29
accomplished:
- app interface visualized and mostly working
- firebase somewhat set up
to do next:
- complete firebase verification, still a bit buggy
- successfully test 2 different accounts. create, log out, sign in again. 
notes for future implementation: 
- use our own automated email system to send verification codes
- check within our program to confirm the user inputted the matching code
- send user email and password info to firebase to store account
